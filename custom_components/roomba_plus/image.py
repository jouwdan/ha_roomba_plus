"""Image platform for Roomba+ — live cleaning map as ImageEntity.

ImageEntity is the correct HA platform for periodically-updated still images.
Unlike Camera, it renders inline in the frontend popup without streaming.

Key behaviour per HA ImageEntity docs:
  - async_image() returns bytes on demand (called by frontend)
  - image_last_updated must be bumped when new image data is available
  - Frontend re-fetches async_image() whenever state changes
  - access_tokens deque must be initialized and async_update_token() called
    once hass is available (in async_added_to_hass)

Mission lifecycle:
  Phase 'run'         -> MapRenderer.reset(), accumulate pose points
  Pose updates        -> MapRenderer.add_pose(), bump image_last_updated
  bbrun.nStuck rises  -> MapRenderer.mark_stuck()
  Phase 'charge' etc  -> ZoneStore.process_mission() (EPHEMERAL only)
                      -> renderer.dump_state() saved to hass.storage

Persistence:
  After every mission end the renderer state (pose points, stuck positions,
  heading) is written to hass.storage under the key
  'roomba_plus_map_{entry_id}'. On async_added_to_hass the stored state
  is restored so the last mission's map survives an HA restart.

  The cached PNG is not stored — it is re-rendered from the persisted points
  on the first async_image() call, which takes <5 ms.

        Fall A (self._dock_anchor_buffering True): a stuck event
        happened earlier this mission and has not yet been resolved.
        The buffered segment is corrected (interpolated, see
        _interpolate_and_correct_segment) and merged into
        _mission_points/_mission_thetas — rescued instead of discarded.
        dock_theta_baseline is NOT fed from this contact: it followed a
        disturbance, not a clean docking (see RobotProfileStore.
        update_dock_theta_baseline's docstring).

        Fall B (not buffering): a normal, undisturbed dock contact
        (recharge-and-resume, or a clean mission end). No buffering
        needed — directly correct the segment since the last dock
        anchor. This IS a clean contact, so it feeds
        dock_theta_baseline.

        Live-map correction (MapRenderer.replace_range) is a best-effort
        approximation: MapRenderer's own point list can be shorter than
        _mission_points/_pending_segment_points (it silently drops
        implausible-jump points that image.py's unfiltered pose stream
        still recorded) — there is no guaranteed 1:1 index
        correspondence between the two. Replacing MapRenderer's last N
        points (N = corrected segment length) is therefore an
        approximation, not an exact replay; acceptable because rejected
        jumps are rare and the live map is a visual aid, not a data

        The constraints, collected here because they were previously
        discoverable only by reading all fourteen comment blocks below:

          1. Clear the checkpoint BEFORE the "nothing to process"
             early-return. A checkpoint may legitimately hold zero pose
             points, and a checkpoint that survives the return is
             re-salvaged on every HA restart, forever. (v2.8.2)

          2. Feed GridStore BEFORE recomputing room segmentation or the
             outline. Both now derive from GridStore.cells, so they
             need this mission's cells already in it. (v3.2.1)

          3. Record poses into MissionTrajectoryStore BEFORE clearing
             self._mission_points. The store reads the same list
             GridStore just consumed. (v3.2.1)

          4. Dock-drift is handled in _handle_dock_contact_confirmed(),
             which runs BEFORE this method. Do not recompute it here --
             that redundancy existed until v3.2.1 and produced two
             independent drift vectors.

        WHY THIS IS A COMMENT AND NOT STRUCTURE. Splitting these steps
        into named methods was considered and rejected: the
        dependencies do not flow through values but through SEVEN
        shared stores as side effects. A signature cannot express "this
        must run after GridStore already contains the current mission",
        so extraction would move the constraint further from the code
        that depends on it, not closer. The ordering is the contract;
        it needs stating, not hiding.

        The step-order test in test_image.py enforces points 2 and 3.

        for accurate dock-return/drift detection) if it turns out the
        mission genuinely did conclude while HA was down.
